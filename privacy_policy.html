  <h1>Privacy Policy for EchoRec Screen Recorder</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 11, 2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for using <strong>EchoRec Screen Recorder</strong> (the ‚ÄúExtension‚Äù). Your privacy and security are important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information and what safeguards are in place.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data or recordings to any server.</strong></p>
  <p>The extension operates entirely on your device. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The extension captures <strong>tab/screen video and microphone audio</strong> <em>only when initiated by you</em>.</li>
    <li>All recordings are processed <strong>locally</strong> and saved directly to your system via the browser‚Äôs download functionality.</li>
    <li>No data leaves your device, and we do not have access to it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Permissions Explained</h2>
  <p>To function properly, the extension requests the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>tabCapture</strong>: To record your browser tab when you start a recording.</li>
    <li><strong>activeTab</strong>: To access the current tab context.</li>
    <li><strong>downloads</strong>: To save the video recordings to your device.</li>
    <li><strong>storage</strong>: To remember your preferences (like minimized view state).</li>
    <li><strong>offscreen</strong>: To enable background media processing in a secure, isolated context.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>These permissions are used strictly for the extension‚Äôs core functionality. No data is collected, logged, or transmitted.</em></p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, tracking, or external APIs. All functionality is self-contained within the extension and the Chrome browser environment.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Since the extension does not collect or transmit any data, <strong>we do not retain any user information</strong>.</p>
  <p>Your recordings are saved <strong>locally</strong> and remain fully under your control.</p>

  <h2>5. Children‚Äôs Privacy</h2>
  <p>This extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected here with a revised effective date. We recommend reviewing this page periodically.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the extension, feel free to contact us at:</p>

  <h2>8. Content Security Policy (CSP)</h2>
  <p>To further protect user security, the EchoRec extension implements a strict Content Security Policy (CSP). This policy restricts which sources can be used for scripts, styles, media, and other content.</p>
  <p>Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scripts are restricted to extension-only sources (no external JS execution).</li>
    <li>Styles are limited to local and inline-safe rules, with no external loading from untrusted sources.</li>
    <li>No remote assets (e.g., fonts, analytics, or images) are loaded from external URLs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This ensures that malicious code injection or data leakage is strongly mitigated, helping maintain a safe recording environment for all users.</p>
